<h1>This is <span class="still">still</span> a motherfucking website.</h1>

<body>

    <h2>Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this shit.</h2>

    <h3>7 fucking declarations.</h3>

    <p>That's how much CSS it took to turn that <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com">grotesque pile of shit</a> into this easy-to-read masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it still has all the glory of the original perfect-ass website:</p>


    <ul>
        <li>Shit's <span class="still">still</span> lightweight and loads fast</li>
        <li> <span class="still">Still</span>fits on all your shitty screens</li>
        <li><span class="still">Still</span>looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
        <li>The motherfucker's<span class="still">still</span> accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
        <li>Shit's<span class="still">Still</span> legible and gets your fucking point across (if you had one instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffee)</li>
    </ul>    


<h2>And guess what, motherfucker:</h2>


    <p>YYou never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. Here's how.</p>


<h2>Let it breathe</h2>


    <p>Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming they're not married they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaults are trash -- pick a minimum <span class="line">line-height: 1.4</span> for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can't see that...piss off.

If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see a book like that? Yes? What a shitty book.</p>

<h2>A little less contrast</h2>


    <p>Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's background a nice #EEEEEE if I wasn't so focused on keeping declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines.</p>

<h2>Size Matters</h2>

    <p>I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy to render close to 16px or more. Smaller type works well for print, not the screen.</p>



<h2>This is a website. Look at it. You've never seen one before.</h2>

<p>Like the man who's never grown out his beard has no idea what his true natural state is, you have no fucking idea what a website is. All you have ever seen are shitty skeuomorphic bastardizations of what should be text communicating a fucking message. This is a real, naked website. Look at it. It's fucking beautiful.</p>

<h2>Line-width, motherfucker</h2>

<p>Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's 200 fucking characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more than one sentence of your worthless dribble.</p>

<h2>Yes, this is <span class="also">also</span>fucking satire, you fuck</h2>

<p>I love what the creator of <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com">this site's inspiration did</a>. What I'm saying is that it's so, so simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not total shit.</p>
